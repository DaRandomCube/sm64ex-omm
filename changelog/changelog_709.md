# Version 7.0.9 (01/02/2022)

## *OMM Builder*:
- Added ***Saturn*** repository: `saex`. This repository shares save data with ***Super Mario 64 ex-nightly*** (`smex`).

## Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where captures triggered the regular star cutscene when touching a Sparkly star.
- Fixed a bug where the regular ground pound made Mario fall faster than a spin pound.
- Fixed a bug where some wooden poles didn't give coins after being fully pounded.
- Fixed a bug where water bombs could cause visual glitches when destroyed.
- Fixed a bug where some enemies didn't spawn Vibe sparkles after being defeated by a Perry or Vibe attack.
- Fixed a coin duplication glitch with Perry attacks.
- Fixed more music cuts (Whomp King defeated before starting the fight, Wiggler in Star Road).
