# Version 6.0.6 (20/11/2021)

## Changes and fixes:
- The `Red Coins Radar` and red coins counter are disabled if the red coins star is already collected.
- Goombas are now less likely to fall off ledges.
- Cappy:
  - Force Cappy to return to Mario during a spin throw or a flying throw if no target is found when attempting to do a homing throw.
  - The homing throw range has been increased for the flying throw, but it uses Mario's position as origin instead of Cappy's.
- Vibes:
  - Reduced the cooldown between two successive activations.
  - The player can now switch between Vibes without having to deactivate the current one first.
- `Odyssey Moveset` only:
  - Fixed glitchy ledge grabs (the ones that make Mario bonk).
  - Leaving a ledge by pressing **(Z)** still results in a soft bonk, but Mario regains control shortly after.
  - You can fire Bob-omb buddies' cannons with **(B)**.
  - Thwomp's collision changed to a cube (like Grindels), as it should be.
