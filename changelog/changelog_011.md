# Version 0.11 (27/07/2020)

## Changes and fixes:
- Mario wall-slides automatically when touching a wall, making wall jumps easier.<br>Additionally, press **(Z)** on a wall to stop wall-sliding.
- Breathing underwater does not drain Mario's power anymore.<br>He has now a separate oxygen meter, visible under Mario's lives counter.

## New actions:
- On the ground, press **(Z)** + **(B)** to do a roll. Press **(Z)** + **(B)** again to keep rolling.
- In the air, press **(Z)** to start a ground pound, then press **(B)** before impact to do an air dive.
- After landing from a ground pound, press **(A)** to do a high jump, or **(Z)** to start rolling.
- Underwater, press **(Z)** to plunge, **(Z)** + **(B)** to do a water dash.<br>These actions make Mario move really fast, but they drain his oxygen meter.

## Cap actions:
- On the ground, in the air or underwater, press **(B)** to throw Mario's cap in front of him.<br>His cap collects coins and secrets and attacks enemies like Goombas or Koopas.
- Touch the cap to bounce on it. If Mario touches it from the ground, he can throw it once more in the air.<br>Underwater, Mario can't interact with his cap, but Metal Mario can.
- For the moment, there is no capture mechanic. Instead, the cap gives to Mario any grabbable object it encounters on its path (Bob-ombs, corkboxes, lil' penguin...)
