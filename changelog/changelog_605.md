# Version 6.0.5 (05/11/2021)

## Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where spawning directly inside the JRB sunken ship activated the low visibility mode if Crystal Stars (Sparkly Stars - Hard mode) were enabled.
- Fixed a bug where Gloom Peach was sometimes not fully invincible to small flames.
- Fixed some graphical glitches on Peach and Perry with the 60 FPS interpolation.

## Changes:
- Collected red coins now display the correct number above them and play the correct sound effect (only noticeable for levels with more than 8 red coins: Veneno-Sphere, Crudelo-Sphere and Ztar Zanctuary in SM74EE).
- Additionally, the pause menu displays the number of collected red coins and the total number of red coins in the current level.
- Wooden posts now drop 5 yellow coins when fully pounded. No need to turn around them anymore.
- Added the `Red Coins Radar` in `Extras`. When enabled, it indicates the direction of the nearest red coin in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
- Added the `Show Star Number` toggle in `Extras`. When enabled, a floating number appears above every visible star to indicate which star of the current level it is.
