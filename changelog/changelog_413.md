# Version 4.1.3 (16/01/2021)

## Changes and fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the player could pause the game during the star dance animation.
- BBH: Fixed a bug where defeating the big Mr. I could spawn a blue coin instead of the `Eye to eye in the secret room` star.
- CCM: Fixed a bug where the game could softlock while rolling towards the snowman's body.
- CCM: Fixed a bug where the snowman's body could respawn more than once.
- Increased Cappy's homing attack max distance.
- Air bonks turn into a freefall after 1 second for backward knockbacks, and after 1.5 second for forward knockbacks.
- Air roll turns into a freefall as soon as Mario's forward velocity goes under 45, only if **(Z)** is not held.
- Added an enhanced version of the 8-directions camera. This camera can replace the vanilla camera inside courses by setting `Mario's Camera` to `8-Directions` from the `Mario` submenu.
