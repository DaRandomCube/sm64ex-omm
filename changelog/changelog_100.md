# Version 1.0.0 (12/08/2020)

## Changes and fixes:
- Mario takes off his cap when Cappy is thrown. (Thanks to s4ys)
- Mario's wall slide is faster.
- Metal Mario can punch and jump kick under water.
- Mario turns while throwing Cappy, making him able to change direction airborne.
- Cappy's throw is now bound to a new button (not the B button anymore).<br>You'll have to go to the Options menu, Controls sub-menu and bind keys for the `X button`.
- Cappy can be thrown in a way that it orbits around Mario by pressing **(X)** and **(A)** simultaneously.
- A sub-menu `Super Mario Odyssey` is available in the Options menu.<br>You can choose from here Mario's moveset and if you want to enable or disable Cappy.<br>By default, Mario's moveset is set to `64 moveset` and Cappy is disabled.
- Two new cheats have been added to the *secret* Cheats sub-menu:<br>`Unlimited Cappy jumps` and `Cappy stays forever`. (Thanks to s4ys for the idea)

## New stuff:
You wanted it, here it is. Now, Mario can capture and possess his enemies! (Well, currently, a few ones)
- In the `Super Mario Odyssey` sub-menu, set Cappy to `Capture`.<br>Throw Cappy to an enemy, and it will try to possess it. Each enemy has a unique way to move and act.<br>For this version, only the enemies present in Bob-omb Battlefield are capturable.<br>This includes Goomba, Koopa, Bob-omb, Bob-omb buddy, Bob-omb King and Chain Chomp.<br>Press **(Z)** while possessing an enemy to leave it. Mario automatically leaves his possession if he takes damage.
- Goomba
  - This little boy can walk, run by holding **(B)** and jump by pressing **(A)**.
  - If you jump on another goomba, you can create a Goomba stack.<br>Jump on other ones to make your stack grow. (with a limit of 8 Goombas)
- Koopa (shelled)
  - This one can walk, jump by pressing **(A)**, and shell-slide by holding **(B)**.
  - Shell-sliding has the same properties as Mario while he rides a shell: knockback enemies, travel on lava...
  - Koopa the Quick is not capturable.
- Koopa (unshelled)
  - The other one can't shell-slide, but can run (for his life).
  - He can get his shell back if he touches it.
- Bob-omb
  - Bob-omb can't run, but launches a destructive explosion when pressing **(B)**.
  - His explosion destroys enemies and brick blocks.
- Bob-omb buddy
  - Mario can't move him around, but reads his dialog without having to talk to him.
  - Mario is automatically ejected when the dialog ends.
  - The cannon variant is also capturable.
- Bob-omb king
  - Just try to capture him.
- Chain chomp
  - While possessing Chain chomp, Mario can move, do big hops by holding **(A)** and perform a bite attack by pressing **(B)**.
  - He's restricted to his chain attached to the wooden post, but can break free if he tries to bite while his chain is fully stretched.
  - When freed, this massive iron ball is invulnerable and knockbacks enemies on contact, and can even break brick blocks and some walls by biting them.
  - Note: Freed chain chomp has a new behavior when Mario leaves it: he will start to chase Mario if he is too close to him.
